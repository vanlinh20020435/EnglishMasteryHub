# EnglishMasteryHub

This app was created with Bootify.io - tips on working with the code [can be found here](https://bootify.io/next-steps/).
Feel free to contact us for further questions.

## Development

When starting the application `docker compose up` is called and the app will connect to the contained services.
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) must be available on the current system.

During development it is recommended to use the profile `local`. In IntelliJ `-Dspring.profiles.active=local` can be
added in the VM options of the Run Configuration after enabling this property in "Modify options". Create your own
`application-local.yml` file to override settings for development.

Lombok must be supported by your IDE. For IntelliJ install the Lombok plugin and enable annotation processing -
[learn more](https://bootify.io/next-steps/spring-boot-with-lombok.html).

After starting the application it is accessible under `localhost:8080`.

## Build

The application can be built using the following command:

```
./gradlew.bat clean build
```

Start your application with the following command - here with the profile `production`:

```
java -jar ./build/libs/EnglishMasteryHub-1.0.0.jar
```

If required, a Docker image can be created with the Spring Boot plugin. Add `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=production` as
environment variable when running the container.

```
./gradlew.bat bootBuildImage --imageName=linhnv2002/english-mastery-hub
```
